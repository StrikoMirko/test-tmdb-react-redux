# Movie listing test app

This is a POC React-Redux app connecting to TMdb API (https://api.themoviedb.org/3/).

It does not have all the bells and whistles but it has heart :D.

### Requirements
`node 6x`
`yarn`

## Setup

```yarn```

## Development

To start development start the development server
```yarn start```

This will create a local webserver at http://localhost:5678 where the app can be accessed and tested.

## Testing

When TDD use command
```yarn test-debug```. This spins up karma in watch mode.

To run tests only once, like for CI/CD run ```yarn test```
## Linting issue
``` yarn lint```

## Fix linting issue
```yarn lint-fix``` to automatically fix problems

## Production
Build the code, compress it and store it in ```dist``` with command ```yarn build```


Have fun and feel free to contact me for any questions.
